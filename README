=head1 NAME

  Test - provides a simple framework for writing test scripts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use strict;
  use Test;
  BEGIN { plan tests => 12, todo => [3,4] }

  ok(0); # failure
  ok(1); # success

  ok(0); # ok, expected failure (see todo list, above)
  ok(1); # surprise success!

  ok(0,1);             # failure: '0' ne '1'
  ok('broke','fixed'); # failure: 'broke' ne 'fixed'
  ok('fixed','fixed'); # success: 'fixed' eq 'fixed'

  ok(sub { 1+1 }, 2);  # success: '2' eq '2'
  ok(sub { 1+1 }, 3);  # failure: '2' ne '3'
  ok(0, int(rand(2));  # (just kidding! :-)

  my @list = (0,0);
  ok(scalar(@list), 3, "\@list=".join(',',@list));  #extra diagnostics

  skip($feature_is_missing, ...);    #do platform specific test

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Harness expects to see particular output when it executes tests.
This module aims to make writing proper test scripts just a little bit
easier (and less error prone :-).

=head1 TEST TYPES

=over 4

=item * NORMAL TESTS

These tests are expected to succeed.  If they don't, something's
screwed up!

=item * SKIPPED TESTS

Skip tests need a platform specific feature that might or might not be
available.  The first argument should evaluate to true if the required
feature is NOT available.  After the first argument, skip tests work
exactly the same way as do normal tests.

=item * TODO TESTS

TODO tests are designed for maintaining an executable TODO list.
These tests are expected NOT to succeed (otherwise the feature they
test would be on the new feature list, not the TODO list).

Packages should NOT be released with successful TODO tests.  As soon
as a TODO test starts working, it should be promoted to a normal test
and the new feature should be documented in the release notes.
