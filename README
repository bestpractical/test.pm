=head1 NAME

  Test - provides a simple framework for writing test scripts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use strict;
  use Test;
  BEGIN { todo tests => 5, failok => [3,4] }

  ok(0); #failure
  ok(1); #success

  ok(0); #ok, expected failure (see failok above)
  ok(1); #surprise success!

  skip($feature_missing, sub {...});    #do platform specific test

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Harness expects to see particular output when it executes test
scripts.  This module tries to make conforming just a little bit
easier (and less error prone).

=head1 TEST CATEGORIES

=over 4

=item * NORMAL TESTS

These tests are expected to succeed.  If they don't, something is
wrong.

=item * SKIPPED TESTS

Skipped tests should be used to skip platform specific tests when a
required feature isn't available.

=item * FAILOK TESTS

Tests listed in failok will never be reported as failures, regardless
of their success.  In fact, they are expected NOT to succeed.  As soon
as a failok test starts working, it should be promoted to a normal
test (remove from the failok list).

Packages should NOT be released with successful failok tests.  Failok
tests are available exclusively for maintaining an executable TODO
list.

=head1 STATUS

This module is currently experimental but I expect it to be merged
back into the main perl distribution soon.
